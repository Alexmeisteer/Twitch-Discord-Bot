# Twitch-Discord-Bot
This Discordbot will send a notification message in a given Discord-chatchannel whenever certain streamers start their stream. This is just the code for the bot and can be setup in a docker container to run in 24/7. 

There will be a video/tutorial on how I set up my bot on a Raspberry Pi 4 and Docker in the near future.
